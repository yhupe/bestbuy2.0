# BESTBUY 2.0

## Description

Bestbuy is a simulation of a simple shop, designed by following an OOP-based design approach. 
With this application, you can instatiate different stores (instances) as well as different products (with a certain price and stock quantity) beloging to the store. 
Further, the CLI allows the user to fulfill actions such as viewing the available products along with its prices and quantities, can add products to the shopping basket and can also do a checkout. 
Once the quantity reaches "0" for a product, it's status turns inactive and it's not possible to add this product to the basket anymore. 

## New features

Further developments on bestbuy (v1.0, see bestbuy in my repo) are the introduction of three different promotions in form of discounts, as well as that there are two new inheriting Product classes, for both unlimited products such as licences or e-books and limited products like a shipping fee, which only can be applied once.  


## How to use

For this simple project, there is no prior installation of requirements needed. Just open the main.py file, instantiate a store and create a product list, you also can instatiate or remove products via the Products class. As seen in the existing code in main.py, you can set and apply the discounts to the products you want. The promotions will be displayed in the CLI accordingly.
Then, you simply can run the main.py file in your IDE or prompt 

```python
python main.py
```
to your terminal.
